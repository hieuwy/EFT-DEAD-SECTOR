## About The Mod
This curated modpack aims to bring a more enjoyable experience for the **employed** players of Escape from Tarkov. In the base game, it is harder to be a force of nature against seasoned players when you have a 9 to 5. This modpack attempts to bring balance towards all aspects of the game as well as keeping it challenging enough for it to be entertaining, but not draining to where you don’t stand a chance.

In previous builds of this modpack, we had plenty of options that gave us overpowered gear and easy access to currency to the point where gameplay became a little too easy and quite stale. This update plans to change that feat. Your chances at dying are a lot higher now. Loot is harder to find, and leveling up requires more time in the zone.

Changes were made at improving AI, more gear variety, leveling balances, user interface, and much more. Enjoy Escape from Tarkov the way it was meant to be played.

This is the new home/repository for the SPT Tarkov mod pack, further updates and planned features will be uploaded here.
