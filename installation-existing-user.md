# INSTALLATION (EXISTING USERS)

## PREREQUISITES

1. Delete all files in your SPT Folder for a fresh installation
2. Update your official Escape from Tarkov Launcher and Client
3. Grab a new installer from SPT's website.

## Step 1

Place your SPTinstaller.exe in your SPT folder.

Click on the SPTinstaller.exe file. A window will appear. The installer will have some pre-checks on the right side for some extra required files.

Once you have all pre-checks with a green check-mark, you are now able to click the “Start Install: SPT v3.10.5" on the bottom right. This will automatically install and clone the required files into your SPT folder.

Once the install finishes, you should be prompted with a message saying “Happy playing”.

Your SPT folder should now look like this:

## Step 2

The following steps will be a guide on how to install the Project Fika/MPT files for our SPT server to run multiplayer. 
*(Be sure to follow these steps carefully or you could run into an error when launching.)*

Head to the installation page for Projecct FIKA. Browse their WIKI for any extra information you may need. [here](https://github.com/project-fika/gitbook-wiki/tree/main/installing-fika)

   a. Download [Fika-Plugin](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin/releases/latest)

   b. Download [fika-Server](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin/releases/latest)

Extract the files from both downloads into your SPT Directory. You should now be good to test if your server is running properly.

Click and open your "SPTLauncher.exe" file. After it opens, you will get an error saying no server is running. This is fine. What you want to do is click on the settings tab on the top right corner of the navigation window.

Enable "Developer Mode" and locate the URL address bar below it.

In the URL field, type in the corresponding IP address to connect to the host's server. In this case, you can copy and pastethe provided URL: ***https://26.253.144.19:6969***

**BE SURE THE URL LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE IT DOES ABOVE**

Press the arrow on the top right of the window and then close your launcher. 

## STEP 3

Here we will install the modpack for EFT - DEAD SECTOR. This is a simple drag and drop process.

Download the latest version of [EFT - DEAD SECTOR]()

Extract the files into your SPT main directory.

## STEP 6

Now start the SPTServer.exe file. It will take some time to initialize for the first time. Wait until everything has loaded and the message: ***happy playing!*** appears. 

Now click and open your SPTLauncher.exe file again. You should be able to create a profile now. It will prompt you to select your edition of choice. Select the one you want. 

Once your profile has been created, launch the game!
